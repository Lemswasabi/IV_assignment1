\section{Assessment of redesign}

How we decided to redesign the infographic:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Deemphasize the non data-ink:} The original graphic has a very low data-ink ratio. Visual representation of the groceries in the graphics is totally unnecessary, since they are labeled with text too. About 60\% of the graphics are non-data ink, which causes a very low data-ink ratio 
    \item \textbf{Deemphasize the layout of the grocery story} supermarket blueprint/floor-plan in bright grey scales to deemphasize
		it's value and possibily to overshadow the essential graphs
	\item augment the data-ink
    \item Preattentive processing
	\item declutter
	\item regroup the data
\end{itemize}

% Push non-data ink into the background (supermarket blueprint)
% Display data in the foreground
