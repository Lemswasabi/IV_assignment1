\section{Assessment of redesign}

How we decided to redesign the infographic:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Deemphasize the non data-ink:} The original graphic has a very low data-ink ratio
    \item supermarket blueprint/floor-plan in bright grey scales to deemphasize
		it's value and possibily to overshadow the essential graphs
	\item augment the data-ink
    \item Preattentive processing
	\item declutter
	\item regroup the data
\end{itemize}
